                <h3> Code of the header file for my personal final project for one of my C++ classes, I implemented a Huffman Tree Encoding and Decoding, there are more files to this project. </h3>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        /*
                            HuffmanTree.h - The concrete class representing a HuffmanTree. Given a specific string of any length, a specific HuffmanTree is created based on the characters in the string
                                            and their frequency in the string, with more frequent characters having a higher weight. This is important because during the building of the HuffmanTree, an array of HuffmanNodes
                                            is pushed onto a prioity queue (a special kind of max heap, where the 'max' is the node with the highest weight, rather than value at the node) and then, while there are more than one
                                            HuffmanTrees (which start as nodes) in this prioity queue, 2 of the nodes are popped, a new parent node is created and linked to these 2 popped nodes, and assigned the sum of their weight
                                            and then pushed back onto the priority queue, this process repeats until there is only one node in the priority queue, this will be the root of the HuffmanTree, and will have all other nodes
                                            linked to it. 
                                            
                                            After this special and specific tree is made, you can use encode and decode using the tree, encode encodes a given string into a string of 1's and 0's representing the path from the root
                                            toward that char position in the tree, decode performs the opposite travesal by going either left or right in the tree, based on the given encoded string, until you reach a leaf node, at this leaf node will
                                            be the decoded character for the originally encoded string.

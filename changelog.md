## Removed
    - Link to the Experiments Page, and removed the page itself.
    - Templates for potential future implementations, a personal message from me and last updated time.
    - Some linebreak elements

## Added
    - Google Analytics to my resume home page, and to personal demos page. Now I am tracking page views, page time, scrolls, outbound clicks, etc. This could be useful to see how much traffic my site is getting, which could affect hosting choices. It could be interesting to see if any potential recruiters (page traffic) are checking me out.
    - More appropriate Output tag where I will output the website's last updated time.
    - JS file for outputting website's last updated time based on the content loading. Also added some CSS to style that area.
    - Another code demo to my personal demos page. It is part of the code needed to do a Huffman Tree encoding in C++.
    - More Books to my favorite book list.
    - A lot of more of my personal philosophy.
    - More skills and goals to the table.

## Changed
    - Fixed some of the responsive CSS for the navigation bar at the top of the page.
